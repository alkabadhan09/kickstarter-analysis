# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The objective is to help playwright Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever. Throughout the module, we have been organizing, sorting, and analyzing data to determine if there are specific factors that contribute to a successful fundraising campaign. And finally in the Kickstarter Challenge, we sorted and visualized data in order to help Louise with outcomes based on Launch Dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose is to analyze the Kickstarter dataset which contains over 4000 projects including categories such as goal amount, pledged amount, country, ID, category and subcategory of the campaign etc. We used Excel to filter, format, sort, and organize data to reach conclusion and also used pivot tables, pivot charts, bar graphs, line graphs etc. to visualize the conclusion. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this deliverable, we analyzed the outcomes for category theater based on the launch dates, specifically months of the year to determine if there is a specific period of the year that people funded a theater play. A Pivot Table and Pivot Chart ware created to help analyze and visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this deliverable, we analyzed data to get the number of successful, canceled, and failed campaigns based on the funding goal. To do that, we used the ‘coutifs’ function with goal amount, outcomes, and category ‘play’ criterias. We also calculated the percentage of the outcomes and created a line chart to visualize the results.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I encountered was using the ‘countifs’ function because I didn’t have much knowledge about it, and it took me some time to get it done. Using the GitHub template and uploading the results were also challenging and it took multiple attempts just to get the README right. 

## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    * May and June hosted the most number of successful campaigns. 
    * Campaigns are not successful during the winter months (November-January). This could be a direct result of holiday season during those months.  

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    
    *	We can conclude that campaigns that had a reasonable funding goal, i.e., $5000-$10000 were mostly successful but campaigns with a higher funding goal had a higher failure rate. 
 
#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
    
    *	We don’t know how the campaigns were advertised (i.e., flyers, advertised in newspaper, radio, television etc.) and if or how it affected the funding goals.
    *	There is no information on the genres of the plays. It would have been helpful to Louise if we know what genres met their fundraising goals which ones didn’t. 

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    
    *	A pivot table and line graph based on the number of backers based on the subcategory. 
    *	Since Louise was also interested in plays from Great Britain, we can make a comparison bar graph based on the launch dates and outcomes of plays from GB and US.
