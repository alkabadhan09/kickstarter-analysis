# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The objective of this project is to analyze the Kickstarter dataset and visualize the outcomes of the campaigns in relation to their funding goals and their launch dates. 

### Purpose
The purpose is to help playwright Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for her play Fever. Throughout the module, we have been organizing, sorting, and analyzing data to determine if there are specific factors that contribute to a successful fundraising campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this deliverable, we analyzed the outcomes for category theater based on the launch dates, specifically months of the year to determine if there is a specific period of the year that people funded a theater play. A Pivot Table and Pivot Chart was created to help analyze and visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this deliverable, we analyzed data to get the number of successful, canceled, and failed campaigns based on the funding goal. To do that, we used the ‘coutifs’ function with goal amount, outcomes, and category ‘play’ criterias. We also calculated the percentage of the outcomes and created a line chart to visualize the results.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I encountered was using the ‘countifs’ function because I didn’t have much knowledge about it, and it took me some time to get it done. Using the GitHub template and uploading the results were also challenging. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
•	May and June hosted the most number of successful campaigns. 
•	Campaigns are not successful during the winter months (November-January). This could be a direct result of holiday season during those months.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
•	We can conclude that campaigns that had a reasonable funding goal, i.e., $5000-$10000 were mostly successful but campaigns with a higher funding goal had a higher failure rate. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	We don’t know how the campaigns were advertised (i.e., flyers, advertised in newspaper, radio, television etc.) and if or how it affected the funding goals.
•	There is no information on the genres of the plays. It would have been helpful to Louise if we know what genres met their fundraising goals which ones didn’t. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
